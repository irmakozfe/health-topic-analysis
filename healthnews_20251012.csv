WHO,WHO tobacco trends report: 1 in 5 adults still addicted to tobacco,"<p>The world is smoking less, but the tobacco epidemic is far from over. A new <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116276"">WHO global report</a> shows the number of tobacco users has dropped from 1.38&nbsp;billion in 2000 to 1.2&nbsp;billion in 2024. Since 2010, the number of people using tobacco has dropped by 120 million &ndash; a 27% drop in relative terms. Yet, tobacco still hooks one in five adults worldwide, fuelling millions of preventable deaths every year.</p><p>&ldquo;Millions of people are stopping, or not taking up, tobacco use thanks to tobacco control efforts by countries around the world,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;In response to this strong progress, the tobacco industry is fighting back with new nicotine products, aggressively targeting young people. Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco control policies.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, WHO has estimated global e-cigarette use &ndash; and the numbers are alarming: more than 100&nbsp;million people worldwide are now vaping. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Adults:</strong> at least 86&nbsp;million users, mostly in high-income countries.</li><li><strong>Adolescents:</strong> at least 15&nbsp;million children (13&ndash;15 years) already using e-cigarettes.

They hit the global reduction target for 2025 five years early, reaching the 30% milestone back in 2020. Prevalence of tobacco use among women dropped from 11% in 2010 to just 6.6% in 2024, with the number of female tobacco users falling from 277&nbsp;million in 2010 to 206&nbsp;million in 2024.</p><p>By contrast, men are not expected to reach the goal until 2031.

WHO,Global health agencies issue new recommendations to help end deaths from postpartum haemorrhage,"<p>Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. The recommendations highlight the urgent need for earlier detection and faster intervention &ndash; steps that could save the lives of tens of thousands of women each year.</p><p>Defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, PPH affects millions of women annually and causes nearly 45&nbsp;000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma.</p><p>&ldquo;Postpartum haemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care,&rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care. &ldquo;These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited &ndash; helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families.&rdquo;</p><h2>New diagnostic criteria for rapid action</h2><p>Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the guidelines introduce new objective diagnostic criteria for detecting PPH, based on the <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01639-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">largest study</a> on the topic to date &ndash; also published today in The Lancet.</p><p>Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning <strong>early detection and rapid response</strong> is critical. Yet in many settings, especially where healthcare resources and labour wards are overstretched, delays in treatment result in devastating consequences.</p><p>Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes &ndash; simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood &ndash; so that they can act immediately when criteria are met.</p><p>The guidelines recommend the immediate deployment of the <strong><a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/09-05-2023-lifesaving-solution-dramatically-reduces-severe-bleeding-after-childbirth"">MOTIVE bundle</a> of actions once PPH has been diagnosed.

They are designed to ensure real-world impact &ndash; empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts.&rdquo;</p><h2>Reducing risks through effective prevention</h2><p>The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails.</p><p>The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth.</p><p>During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort.</p><p>&ldquo;Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum haemorrhage can escalate and cost lives,&rdquo; said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM&rsquo;s Chief Midwife. &ldquo;These guidelines are a game-changer.

WHO,WHO statement on autism-related issues,"<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that there is currently no conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link between autism and use of acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) during pregnancy.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Globally, nearly 62 million people (1 in 127) have autism spectrum disorder, a diverse group of conditions related to development of the brain. Although awareness and diagnosis have improved in recent years, the exact causes of autism have not been established, and it is understood there are multiple factors that can be involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Extensive research has been undertaken over the past decade, including large-scale studies, looking into links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. At this time, no consistent association has been established.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>WHO recommends that all women continue to follow advice of their doctors or health workers, who can help assess individual circumstances and recommend necessary medicines. Any medicine should be used with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first three months, and in line with advice from health professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, a robust, extensive evidence base exists showing childhood vaccines do not cause autism. Large, high-quality  studies from many countries have all reached the same conclusion. Original studies suggesting a link were flawed and have been discredited. Since 1999, independent experts advising WHO have repeatedly confirmed that vaccines&mdash;including those with thiomersal or aluminum&mdash;do not cause autism or other developmental disorders.  &nbsp;<br /></p><p>Childhood vaccine schedules are developed through a careful, extensive and evidence-based process involving global experts and country input. The childhood immunization schedule, carefully guided by WHO, has been adopted by all countries, and has saved at least 154 million lives over the past 50 years.

Medicines for cystic fibrosis, psoriasis, haemophilia and blood-related disorders are among the other additions.</p><p>WHO EML and EMLc include medicines for priority health needs of populations. They are adopted in over 150 countries, serving as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, reimbursement schemes. The revisions mark the 24<sup>th</sup> edition of WHO EML and 10<sup>th</sup> edition of EMLc. </p><p>&ldquo;The new editions of essential medicines lists mark a significant step toward expanding access to new medicines with proven clinical benefits and with high potential for global public health impact,&rdquo; said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, Assistant Director-General for Health Systems, Access and Data.</p><p>Launched in 1977 largely to promote better access to medicines in developing countries, the WHO Model Lists have become a trusted global policy tool for decisions related to the selection and universal coverage of medicines within all health systems.</p><p>The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines reviewed 59 applications, including 31 proposals for the addition of new medicines or medicine classes. As a result, 20 new medicines were added to the EML and 15 to the EMLc, along with new use indications for seven already-listed products. The updated lists now include a total of 523 essential medicines for adults and 374 for children, reflecting the most pressing public health needs. </p><h2>Cancer medicines<strong> </strong></h2><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, claiming nearly 10 million lives each year and responsible for almost one in three premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases. Cancer treatments have been a major focus of the WHO EML for the past decade. With cancer medicines accounting today for about half of all new drug approvals by regulatory agencies, the Expert Committee applies rigorous criteria to recommend only those therapies that offer the greatest clinical benefit. As a result, few approved cancer medicines are included &ndash; only those proven to prolong life by at least 4-6 months.</p><p>Seven applications encompassing 25 cancer medicines were evaluated. As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the Committee recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, a class of immunotherapy medicines that help the body&rsquo;s immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Pembrolizumab was added to the EML as a first-line monotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For the latter, atezolizumab and cemiplimab are included as therapeutic alternatives.</p><p>The Committee also considered several expert-recommended strategies &ndash; highlighted in the <a href=""https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2025-eml-expert-committee/comments/cancer-expert-report.pdf?sfvrsn=41918b2d_1"">cancer experts report</a> &ndash; aimed at improving access to and affordability of cancer treatments. It endorsed evidence-based clinical and health system strategies, including dose optimisation approaches, to improve access. The Committee emphasized that while health system reforms require time and government action, clinical strategies can be implemented immediately to deliver faster benefits, especially in resource-limited settings. </p><h2>Medicines for diabetes and obesity</h2><p>Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. Over 800 million people were living with diabetes in 2022, with half going untreated. At the same time, more than 1 billion people&nbsp;worldwide are affected by obesity, and rates are rising especially fast in low- and middle-income countries. These two conditions are closely linked and can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and kidney failure.</p><p>The WHO Expert Committee reviewed strong scientific evidence showing that a group of medicines called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists can help people with type 2 diabetes &ndash; especially those who also have heart or kidney disease &ndash; by improving blood sugar control, reducing the risk of heart and kidney complications, supporting weight loss, and even lowering the risk of early death. </p><p>GLP-1 receptor agonists &ndash; semaglutide, dulaglutide and liraglutide &ndash; and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual receptor agonist (tirzepatide) have been added to the EML.

This provides clear guidance to countries on which patients can benefit most from these therapies.</p><p>High prices of medicines like semaglutide and tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. Prioritizing those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care &ndash; especially in underserved areas &ndash; are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes. WHO will continue monitoring developments, support fair pricing strategies, and help countries improve access to these life-changing treatments.</p><p>&ldquo;A large share of out-of-pocket spending on noncommunicable diseases goes toward medicines, including those classified as essential and that, in principle, should be financially accessible to everyone,&rdquo; said Deusdedit Mubangizi, WHO Director of Policy and Standards for Medicines and Health Products. &ldquo;Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centred programmes that leave no one behind.&rdquo;</p><p>More details of the Expert Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, describing the additions, changes and removal of medicines and formulations, and decisions not to recommend medicines are available in the Executive Summary&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B09544"">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Note to editors</strong></p><p>The meeting of the 25th WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines was held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, from 5 to 9 May 2025.
