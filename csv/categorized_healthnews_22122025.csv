WHO,2025-12-18 15:43:16+00:00,Pandemic,WHO validates Brazil for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV,"<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Brazil for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, making it the most populous country in the Americas to achieve this historic milestone. This accomplishment reflects Brazil&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to universal and free access to health services through its Unified Health System (SUS), anchored in a strong primary health-care system and respect for human rights.</p><p>&ldquo;Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV is a major public health achievement for any country, especially for a country as large and complex as Brazil,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;Brazil has shown that with sustained political commitment and equitable access to quality health services, every country can ensure that every child is born free of HIV and every mother receives the care she deserves.&rdquo;</p><p>The milestone was marked during a ceremony in Bras&iacute;lia, attended by President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, Brazil&rsquo;s Minister of Health<strong> </strong>Alexandre Padilha, and the Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Dr Jarbas Barbosa, along with representatives from  UNAIDS.</p><h2>Meeting validation criteria</h2><p>Brazil met all the criteria for EMTCT validation, including reducing vertical transmission of HIV to below 2% and achieving over 95% coverage for prenatal care, routine HIV testing, and timely treatment for pregnant women living with HIV. In addition to meeting the targets of the validation, Brazil demonstrated the delivery of quality services for mothers and their infants, robust data and laboratory systems, and a strong commitment to human rights, gender equality and community engagement.</p><p>The country implemented a progressive, subnational approach by first certifying states and municipalities with over 100 000 inhabitants, adapting the PAHO/WHO validation methodology to its national context while maintaining coherence across the country.</p><p>The evaluation, supported by PAHO, was conducted by independent experts who reviewed data, documentation, and health facility operations. Findings were then assessed by WHO&rsquo;s Global Validation Advisory Committee, which formally recommended Brazil&rsquo;s validation for elimination.</p><p>&ldquo;This achievement shows that eliminating vertical transmission of HIV is possible when pregnant women know their HIV status, receive timely treatment, and have access to maternal health services and safe delivery,&rdquo; said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO. &ldquo;It is also the result of the tireless dedication of thousands of health professionals, community health workers, and civil society organizations. Every day, they sustain the continuity of care, identify obstacles, and work to overcome them, ensuring that even the most vulnerable populations can access essential health services.""</p><h2>Part of a broader initiative</h2><p>Over the past decade (2015-2024), more than 50 000 pediatric HIV infections have been averted in the Region of the Americas as a result of the implementation of the initiative to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p><p>Brazil&rsquo;s success is part of the broader EMTCT Plus Initiative, which seeks to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and congenital Chagas, in collaboration with UNICEF and UNAIDS. It is embedded within PAHO&rsquo;s <a href=""https://www.paho.org/en/elimination-initiative"">Elimination Initiative</a>, a regional effort to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Americas by 2030.</p><p>""I am delighted that Brazil has just been certified by WHO/PAHO for eliminating vertical transmission &ndash; the first country of more than 100 million people to do so,&rdquo; said Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director. &ldquo;And they did it by doing what we know works &ndash;prioritizing universal health care, tackling the social determinants that drive the epidemic, protecting human rights, and even &ndash; when necessary &ndash; breaking monopolies to secure access to medicines.""</p><h2>Global context</h2><p>Brazil is one of 19 countries and territories worldwide that have been validated by WHO for EMTCT. Twelve of these are in the Region of the Americas. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to be validated for EMTCT of HIV and the elimination of congenital syphilis. Other countries in the Region include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2017; Dominica in 2020; Belize in 2023; and Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2024.</p><p>Outside the Americas, countries validated for EMTCT of HIV include Armenia, Belarus, Malaysia, Maldives, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.who.int/news/item/18-12-2025-who-validates-brazil-for-eliminating-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv
WHO,2025-12-17 08:09:29+00:00,Other,"WHO hosts the second Global Summit to advance evidence, integration and innovation for traditional medicine","<p>The World Health Organization (WHO)&rsquo;s <a href=""https://tm-summit.org/"">Second Global Summit on Traditional Medicine</a>, jointly organized with the Government of India, opens today, bringing together government ministers, scientists, Indigenous leaders, and practitioners from more than 100 countries. The Summit is expected to announce major scientific initiatives and new commitments aimed at advancing the implementation of the  <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240113176"">WHO Global Traditional Medicine Strategy 2025&ndash;2034</a>, centred on stronger evidence, better regulation,&nbsp;systems integration, collaboration and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine"">Traditional medicine</a> (TM) encompasses codified and non-codified systems that predate biomedicine and have continued to evolve for contemporary use. For many, TM remains the main source of health care&mdash;locally accessible, affordable and bio-culturally aligned&mdash;and for many more, it is a preferred, personalized and more natural health option. Nearly 90% of WHO Member States (170 out of 194) report that&nbsp;40&ndash;90%&nbsp;of their populations use TM.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;WHO is committed to uniting the wisdom of millennia with the power of modern science and technology to realise the vision of health for all,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;By engaging responsibly, ethically, and equitably, and by harnessing innovation from AI to genomics, we can unlock the potential of traditional medicine to deliver safer, smarter, and more sustainable health solutions for every community and for our planet.&rdquo;<br /></p><h2>Strengthening evidence, regulation and integration of TM into health systems</h2><p>In a world facing increasing challenges to health systems, nearly half of the global population &ndash; 4.6 billion &ndash; lack access to essential health services, while a quarter &ndash; over 2 billion people&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/universal-health-coverage-(uhc)"">experience financial hardship to access health care</a>. Integrating TM into health systems is critical to expanding access and choice to affordable, people-centred health care and advancing UHC, ensuring everyone can receive health care they need without financial strain.</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that integrating TM into health systems can deliver cost efficiencies and improve health outcomes. Such integration emphasizes prevention and health promotion, contributing to broader health benefits such as more appropriate use of antibiotics.</p><p>Achieving effective integration requires robust science, global standards for quality and safety, and strong regulatory mechanisms. &ldquo;We need to apply the same scientific rigour to the assessment and validation of biomedicine and traditional medicines, while respecting biodiversity, cultural specificities and ethical principles,&rdquo; said Dr Sylvie Briand, WHO Chief Scientist. &ldquo;Stronger collaborations and frontier technologies &ndash; such as AI, genomics, systems biology, neurosciences and advanced data analytics &ndash; can transform how we study and apply traditional medicine.&rdquo;</p><h2>Advancing innovation, investment and sustainable benefits</h2><p>TM underpins fast-growing global industries, such as herbal medicines. All TM formulations, and more than half of biomedical pharmaceuticals, originate from natural resources, which remain a vital source for new drug discovery. Indigenous Peoples safeguard around 40% of the world&rsquo;s biodiversity while representing just 6% of the global population. Advancing TM requires addressing Indigenous rights, fair trade, and benefit-sharing considerations.<br /></p><p>Despite TM&rsquo;s widespread use and vital role in stewarding natural resources for health and well-being, less than 1% of global health research funding is dedicated to TM. To help close the knowledge and research gaps, WHO is launching the Traditional Medicine Global Library, the first of its kind, featuring more than 1.6 million scientific records spanning research, policies, regulations and thematic collections on diverse TM applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Developed in response to calls by Heads of State during G20 and BRICS meetings in 2023, the Library also provides equitable online access to peer-reviewed content for institutions in lower-income countries through the Research4Life initiative. It also supports countries in documenting TM with intellectual property protections and in building scientific capacity to drive innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Advancing traditional medicine is an evidence-based, ethical and environmental imperative,&rdquo; said Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, Director a.i. of WHO&rsquo;s Global Traditional Medicine Centre. &ldquo;The Global Summit fosters the conditions and collaborations required for TM to contribute at scale to the flourishing of all people and the planet.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The Summit (17&ndash;19 December 2025, New Delhi) will also announce new commitments from governments and other stakeholders, alongside a call for a global consortium to address systemic gaps and accelerate implementation of the Global TM Strategy at scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.who.int/news/item/17-12-2025-who-hosts-the-second-global-summit-to-advance-evidence--integration-and-innovation-for-traditional-medicine

WHO,2025-12-06 01:45:23+00:00,Policy and system,"Most countries make progress towards universal health coverage, but major challenges remain, WHO–World Bank report finds","<p>Since 2000, most countries &ndash; across all income levels and regions &ndash; have made concurrent progress in expanding health service coverage and reducing the financial hardship associated with health costs, according to a new joint report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank Group. These two indicators are the foundation of universal health coverage (UHC) &ndash; the global commitment that everyone, everywhere can access the care they need without financial hardship by 2030.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240117815"">UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025</a> shows that health service coverage, measured by the Service Coverage Index (SCI), rose from 54 to 71 points between 2000 and 2023. Meanwhile, the share of people experiencing financial hardship due to large and impoverishing out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments declined from 34% to 26% between 2000 and 2022.</p><p>However, the report cautions that the poorest populations continue to bear the greatest burden of unaffordable health costs, with 1.6&nbsp;billion people further pushed into poverty. Overall, an estimated 4.6&nbsp;billion people worldwide still lack access to essential health services and 2.1&nbsp;billion people experience financial hardship to access health care, including the 1.6&nbsp;billion people living in poverty or pushed deeper into it due to health expenses.</p><p>""Universal health coverage is the ultimate expression of the right to health, but this report shows that for billions of people who cannot access or afford the health services they need, that right remains out of reach,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;In the context of severe cuts to international aid, now is the time for countries to invest in their health systems, to protect the health of their people and economies. WHO is supporting them to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Financial hardship in health is defined as household spending more than 40% of its discretionary budget on OOP health expenses. Cost of medicines is a major driver of financial hardship: in three-quarters of countries with available data, medicines account for at least 55% of people&rsquo;s OOP health expenses. The burden is even greater among people living in poverty who allocate a median of 60% of their OOP health expenses on medicines diverting their scarce resources from other essential needs.</p><p>While the burden of OOP health costs falls mostly on poorer people, it also affects better-off segments of the population that allocate a large share of their budgets to health expenses, particularly in middle-income countries where this group of people is growing.</p><p>Without faster progress, full-service coverage without financial hardship will remain out of reach for many: the global SCI is projected to reach only 74 out of 100 by 2030, with nearly 1 in 4 people worldwide still facing financial hardship at the end of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era.</p><h2>Encouraging progress in low-income countries with largest gaps</h2><p>Despite positive direction, the global progress rate has slowed since 2015 with only one-third of countries improving in both increasing health coverage and reducing financial hardship. All WHO regions have improved service coverage, but only half &ndash; Africa, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific &ndash; also reduced financial hardship. Low-income countries achieved the fastest gains in both areas but are still facing  the largest gaps.</p><p>The global increase in health service coverage has been driven largely by advances in infectious disease programmes. Coverage for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has shown steady improvement, while gains in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health have been modest.</p><p>The report notes that improved sanitation has supported service coverage gains. At the same time, inclusive economic growth, rising incomes, and stronger social protection mechanisms have driven poverty reduction, especially in low-income countries, contributing to declines in financial hardship. However, health costs have increasingly become a source of financial hardship among the poor.</p><h2>Inequalities are getting starker</h2><p>Despite progress, persistent gaps and inequalities are on the rise. In 2022, 3 out of 4 people among the poorest segment of the populations faced financial hardship from health costs, compared with fewer than 1 in 25 among the richest.</p><p>Women, people living in poverty, or in rural areas, or with less education, reported greater difficulty accessing essential health services. The gap between women in the richest and poorest quintiles narrowed slightly, from about 38 to 33 percentage points over the past decade. Even in high-performing regions such as Europe, vulnerable groups &ndash; including the poorest and people with disabilities &ndash; continue to report higher unmet health needs.</p><p>These findings likely underestimate the true extent of health inequalities, as the most vulnerable groups &ndash; such as displaced populations and people living in informal settlements &ndash; are often missing in data sources used to monitor progress toward UHC.</p><h2>Actions leading to 2030</h2><p>Achieving the UHC goal by 2030 is central to realizing the human right to health. With five years remaining on the SDG agenda, urgent action is now needed to  drive progress. The report underscores the critical role of political commitment in every country and community, and calls for action in six core areas:</p><ul><li>ensure essential health care is free at the point of care for people living in poverty and vulnerable situations;</li><li>expand public investments in health systems;</li><li>address high out-of-pocket spending on medicines;</li><li>accelerate access to essential NCD services, especially as the disease burden rises;</li><li>strengthen primary health care to promote equity and efficiency; and </li><li>adopt multisectoral approaches, recognizing that determinants of health and UHC drivers extend beyond the health sector.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Editor&rsquo;s note</h2><p>This edition of the UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025 reflects the first round of UHC tracking to incorporate revised SDG indicators for health service coverage (SDG 3.8.1) and financial hardship (SDG 3.8.2), introduced in 2025. Using the revised indicators, and reproduction of the full time series, the report has presented global and regional trends in service coverage from 2000 to 2023, based on time series data for 195 countries or territories, and global and regional trends in financial hardship from 2000 to 2022, based on primary country time series for 168 countries.

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition estimates that, as of October 2025, 2.5 million people who used PrEP in 2024 lost access to their medications in 2025 due solely to donor funding cuts. Such disruptions could have far-reaching consequences for the global HIV response, jeopardizing efforts to end AIDS by 2030. </p><h2>Momentum for innovation<strong> </strong></h2><p><strong></strong>&ldquo;We are entering a new era of powerful innovations in HIV prevention and treatment,&rdquo; said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO&rsquo;s Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis and STIs. &ldquo;By pairing these advances with decisive action, supporting communities, and removing structural barriers, we can ensure that key and vulnerable populations have full access to life-saving services.&rdquo; </p><p>WHO prequalified LEN for HIV prevention on 6 October 2025, followed by national regulatory approvals that will increase access in South Africa (on 27 October), Zimbabwe (27 November) and Zambia (4 November). WHO&rsquo;s Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) supported these approvals. WHO is also working closely with partners such as CIFF, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Unitaid to enable affordable access to LEN in countries. Ensuring that long-acting HIV medicines for prevention and treatment reach priority populations must be a global priority. </p><h2>Integrating HIV services into primary health care</h2><p><strong></strong>WHO emphasizes that ending the AIDS epidemic depends on a fully integrated, evidence-based and rights-driven approach under the umbrella of primary health care. WHO will continue working with partners and leaders to put those most affected at the centre of the HIV response. Despite funding setbacks, the resilience and leadership of communities offer a clear path forward. By strengthening health systems, increasing domestic investment, and protecting human rights, countries can safeguard gains and ensure no one is left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2025-new-prevention-tools-and-investment-in-services-essential-in-the-fight-against-aids

WHO,2025-11-19 11:34:26+00:00,Depression,Lifetime toll: 840 million women faced partner or sexual violence,"<p>Violence against women remains one of the world&rsquo;s most persistent and under-addressed human rights crises, with very little progress in two decades, according to a <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116962"">landmark report</a> released today by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN partners.</p><p>Nearly 1 in 3 women &ndash; estimated 840 million globally &ndash; have experienced partner or sexual violence during their lifetime, a figure that has barely changed since 2000. In the last 12 months alone, 316 million women &ndash; 11% of those aged 15 or older &ndash; were subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Progress on reducing intimate partner violence has been painfully slow with only 0.2% annual decline over the past two decades.</p><p>For the first time, the report includes national and regional estimates of sexual violence by someone other than a partner. It finds 263 million women have experienced non-partner sexual violence since age 15, a figure experts caution is significantly under-reported due to stigma and fear.</p><p>""Violence against women is one of humanity&rsquo;s oldest and most pervasive injustices, yet still one of the least acted upon,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""No society can call itself fair, safe or healthy while half its population lives in fear. Ending this violence is not only a matter of policy; it is a matter of dignity, equality and human rights. Behind every statistic is a woman or girl whose life has been forever altered. &nbsp;Empowering women and girls is not optional, it's a prerequisite for peace, development and health. A safer world for women is a better world for everyone.""</p><h3>Efforts face funding cuts amidst mounting needs</h3><p>The new report, released ahead of the <em>International day for the elimination of violence against women and girls</em> observed on 25 November, represents the most comprehensive study on the prevalence of these two forms of violence against women. It updates 2018 estimates released in 2021. It analyses data between 2000 and 2023 from 168 countries, revealing a stark picture of a deeply neglected crisis and critically underfunded response.</p><p>Despite mounting evidence on effective strategies to prevent violence against women, the report warns that funding for such initiatives is collapsing &ndash; just as when humanitarian emergencies, technological shifts, and rising socio-economic inequality are further increasing risks for millions of women and girls. For instance, in 2022, only 0.2% of the global development aid was allocated to programmes focused on prevention of violence against women, and funding has further fallen in 2025.</p><h3>Widespread and lifelong risks</h3><p>Women subjected to violence face unintended pregnancies, a higher risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and experiencing depression. Sexual and reproductive health services are an important entry point for survivors to receive the high-quality care they need.</p><p>The report underscores the reality that violence against women begins early and risks persist throughout life. For example, in the past 12 months alone, 12.5 million adolescent girls 15-19 years of age or 16% have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner.</p><p>While violence occurs in every country, women in least-developed, conflict-affected, and climate-vulnerable settings are disproportionately affected. For example, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) reports 38% prevalence of intimate partner violence in the past year &ndash; more than 3 times the global average of 11%.</p><h3>A call for action &ndash; and accountability</h3><p>More countries than ever are now collecting data to inform policies, yet significant gaps remain &ndash; particularly on non-partner sexual violence, marginalized groups such as indigenous women, migrants, and women with disabilities, as well as data from fragile and humanitarian settings.&nbsp;</p><p>Progress has been achieved in countries where there is political commitment to do so. For example, Cambodia is implementing a national project that will update legislation on domestic violence, improve service delivery, quality and access, refurbish shelters and leverage digital solutions in schools and communities to promote prevention especially with adolescents.</p><p>Ecuador, Liberia, Trinidad and Tobago and Uganda have developed costed national action plans. Legislative and advocacy actions in these countries have contributed to some domestic financing for this issue, signalling increased political commitment at a time of decreasing aid budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>To accelerate global progress and deliver meaningful change for the lives of affected women and girls, the report calls for decisive government action and funding to:</p><ul><li>scale up evidence-based prevention programmes</li><li>strengthen survivor-centred health, legal and social services</li><li>invest in data systems to track progress and reach the most at-risk groups</li><li>enforce laws and policies empowering women and girls.</li></ul><p>The report is accompanied by the launch of the second edition of the <em><a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240117020"">RESPECT Women: preventing violence against women framework</a></em>, offering updated guidance for violence prevention, including for humanitarian contexts.</p><p>There can be no more silence or inaction. We need leaders to commit and act towards ending violence against women and girls now.</p><h3>Quotes from partners</h3><p>""Ending violence against women and girls requires courage, commitment, and collective action. Advancing gender equality&nbsp;is how we build a more equal, safer world for everyone, where every woman and every girl can live a life free from violence.&rdquo; <strong>Dr&nbsp;Sima&nbsp;Bahous, Executive Director, UN Women</strong>
 <br /></p><p>""Violence against women inflicts deep and lasting harm that affects their lives, health and dignity. For many, violence is compounded by discrimination based on poverty, disability and other factors, exposing them to even higher risk. The devastating cycle of abuse often ripples through families and communities and across generations. The data paint a grim picture of the toll of inaction. This must change now. We must act urgently together to end this violence and ensure that every woman and girl, in all her diversity, can exercise her rights, realize her potential and contribute fully to more just, equal and prosperous societies.&rdquo; <strong>Diene Keita, Executive Director, UNFPA</strong>
 <br /></p><p>&ldquo;The data shows that many women first experience violence from a partner when they are adolescents. And many children grow up watching their mothers being pushed, hit or humiliated, with violence a part of daily life. The key is to break this pattern of violence against women and girls.&rdquo; <strong>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell</strong>
 </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Notes to the editors</h3><p><strong>About the report</strong></p><p>The report, <em>Global, regional and national prevalence estimates for intimate partner violence against women and non-partner sexual violence against women, 2023</em> was developed by WHO and the UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) on behalf of, and with the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data. The Working Group includes representatives from WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).</p><p>Modelling is used to enhance comparability of estimates across countries and regions to the extent allowed by existing data. All surveys likely underestimate the actual prevalence of violence against women as there will always be women who do not disclose these experiences, especially where this violence is highly stigmatized. Sexual violence is particularly underreported in many settings. Poorly designed or implemented surveys in some places further exacerbate this underestimation.</p><p><strong>About regional and country estimates</strong></p><p>The report and database present regional data in the following categories: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions, WHO regions, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, UNFPA regions and UNICEF regions.

WHO,2025-11-19 10:01:44+00:00,Other,"More countries report rising levels of drug-resistant gonorrhoea, warns WHO","<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted infection, is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, according to new data from its <em>Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP)</em>, which monitors the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhoea.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240117297"">report</a> highlights the need to strengthen surveillance, improve diagnostic capacity and ensure equitable access to new treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The release of the new data coincides with  <a href=""https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-amr-awareness-week/2025"">World Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Awareness Week</a>, reinforcing the importance of global action against drug-resistant infections.  <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240021341"">EGASP,</a> launched by WHO in 2015, collects laboratory and clinical data from sentinel sites around the world to track AMR and inform treatment guidelines.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This global effort is essential to tracking, preventing, and responding to drug-resistant gonorrhoea and to protecting public health worldwide,&rdquo; said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis &amp; STIs. &ldquo;WHO calls on all countries to address the rising levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and integrate gonorrhoea surveillance into national STI programmes.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Between 2022 and 2024, resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime, the primary antibiotics used to treat gonorrhoea, rose sharply from 0.8% to 5% and from 1.7% to 11% respectively, with resistant strains detected in more countries. Resistance to azithromycin remained stable at 4%, while resistance to ciprofloxacin reached 95%. Cambodia and Viet Nam reported the highest resistance rates.<br /></p><p>In 2024, 12 EGASP countries in five WHO regions provided data, an increase from just four countries in 2022. This is a positive development reflecting growing commitment to track and contain drug-resistant infections in countries and regions. The countries- Brazil, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malawi, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Uganda and Viet&nbsp;Nam reported 3615 cases of gonorrhoea.<br /></p><p>Over half of all cases of symptomatic gonorrhoea in men (52%) were reported from countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, including the Philippines (28%), Viet Nam (12%), Cambodia (9%) and Indonesia (3%). Countries of the WHO African Region accounted for 28% of cases, followed by countries in the South-East Asia Region (13%, Thailand), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (4%, Qatar) and the Region of the Americas (2%, Brazil).<br /></p><p>The median patient age was 27 years (range: 12&ndash;94).

WHO,2025-11-14 17:39:52+00:00,Other,WHO promotes lifesaving intervention for small and preterm babies on first official World Prematurity Day,"<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is marking its first official observance of World Prematurity Day with the launch of a new global clinical practice guide for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) &ndash; a simple, proven and life-saving intervention that significantly improves survival for preterm and low birth weight babies.</p><p>Each year, an estimated 15 million babies are born too soon (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. In the poorest countries, most extremely preterm babies die within days &ndash; whereas in high-income countries, almost all survive.</p><p>KMC &ndash; which combines prolonged skin to skin contact with breast-milk feeding &ndash; has been shown to dramatically improve outcomes for small and preterm newborns, and to be feasible and cost-effective in all settings. Among other positive impacts, it is associated with a more than 30% reduction in newborn deaths, a close to 70% reduction in hypothermia and a 15% reduction in severe infections &ndash; as well as improved weight gain and better longer-term health and cognitive development. </p><p>&ldquo;KMC is not just a clinical intervention &ndash; it empowers mothers and families and transforms newborn care,&rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO&rsquo;s Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. &ldquo;It should now be universal clinical practice for all small and preterm babies, ensuring they have the best chance to survive and thrive.&rdquo;</p><h2>A lifesaving intervention for all babies born early or small</h2><p>Geared at health workers, facility managers as well as caregivers, the new WHO guide offers detailed, step-by-step, adaptable guidance for initiating, maintaining, and monitoring KMC. It states that all preterm or low birth weight newborns should receive KMC starting immediately after birth - unless they are unable to breathe on their own or their blood pressure and circulation drops to dangerously low levels, requiring urgent treatment. </p><p>While mothers should typically be the primary providers, fathers and other family members can also give KMC if the mother is unable &ndash; as well as providing critical emotional and practical support. KMC can be practiced at all levels of health facilities &ndash; from the labour room or the operating theatre to postnatal wards and special or intensive newborn care units &ndash; and can be continued at home. </p><p>The guide includes practical tips on how to secure the baby in the KMC position, whether using simple cloth wraps, elastic binders or specially designed garments. It also outlines how health facilities create enabling environments for KMC through supportive policies and training staff. Family-friendly approaches are crucial for successful implementation, the guide notes &ndash; including ensuring mothers can always be together in the same room as their babies.</p><h2>All small and sick newborns need dedicated medical care and attention</h2><p>On this World Prematurity Day, with the theme &lsquo;<em>A strong start for a hopeful future&rsquo;</em>, WHO is calling on governments, health systems and partners to prioritize quality care for preterm and low birth weight babies. This means ensuring dedicated wards or facilities with specially trained neonatal staff providing round-the-clock care for small and sick newborns, as well as universal access to essential equipment and medicines like antibiotics. </p><p>Because they have less time in the womb, many preterm babies have underdeveloped lungs, brains, immune systems and capacity for temperature regulation. This increases risks from infections, hypothermia, heart problems, respiratory distress, and other life-threatening complications. </p><p>&ldquo;No newborn should die from preventable causes,&rdquo; said Dr Per Ashorn, WHO&rsquo;s Unit Head for Newborn and Child Health and Development. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to ensure every baby gets the attention they need, by investing in special care for small or sick babies, alongside quality maternity services that can prevent many occurrences of preterm birth.&rdquo;</p><p></p>",https://www.who.int/news/item/14-11-2025-who-promotes-lifesaving-intervention-for-small-and-preterm-babies-on-first-official-world-prematurity-day

WHO,2025-11-12 09:43:51+00:00,Measles,Egypt becomes the seventh country in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem,"<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced that Egypt has successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem, marking a historic public health milestone for the country and WHO&rsquo;s Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR). It is the seventh country in WHO EMR to achieve this milestone. The validation of Egypt&rsquo;s achievement brings the total number of countries that have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem worldwide to 27.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I congratulate Egypt for reaching this milestone and liberating its people from trachoma,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.&nbsp; &ldquo;This demonstrates the effectiveness of sustained national leadership, strong surveillance and community engagement in ending a disease that has afflicted humanity since antiquity.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Following Egypt&rsquo;s success, Trachoma remains a public health problem in 30 countries and is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. Blindness from trachoma is difficult to reverse. Based on April 2025 data, 103 million people live in trachoma endemic areas and are at risk of trachoma blindness.<br /></p><h3>A century-long journey against trachoma<br /></h3><p>Trachoma has been documented in Egypt for over 3,000 years. Public health efforts to address its burden began in the early 20th century, when pioneering ophthalmologist Arthur Ferguson MacCallan established Egypt&rsquo;s first mobile and permanent eye hospitals and laid the groundwork for organized trachoma control globally. Yet by the 1980s, it still blinded many adults and affected over half of all children in some Nile Delta communities.<br /></p><p>Since 2002, the Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt, in partnership with WHO and other national and international stakeholders, has pursued trachoma elimination through the WHO-endorsed SAFE strategy, which represents Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics to clear the causative organism, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>Between 2015 and 2025, extensive mapping and surveillance across all 27 of Egypt&rsquo;s governorates showed steady reductions in the proportion of children aged 1&ndash;9 years affected by active (inflammatory) trachoma, and no significant burden of the blinding complications of trachoma in adults. Both indicators are now below WHO elimination prevalence thresholds nationwide. In 2024, Egypt integrated trachoma surveillance into its national electronic disease reporting system, which should facilitate rapid response to any future cases.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Egypt&rsquo;s elimination of trachoma as a public health problem underscores the nation&rsquo;s sustained commitment to equitable healthcare delivery and the transformative impact of initiatives such as Haya Karima, which have expanded access to safe water, sanitation, and primary care services in rural communities,&rdquo; said Professor Dr. Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and Population. &ldquo;This achievement is a collective triumph for Egypt&rsquo;s health workers, communities, and partners who collaborated to eradicate this ancient disease.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Trachoma is the second neglected tropical disease (NTD) eliminated in Egypt, as in 2018 the country was validated by WHO for eliminating lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. In total, 58 countries have eliminated at least one NTD globally, nine of which are in WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This milestone adds to Egypt&rsquo;s strong track record in eliminating communicable diseases, including polio, measles, rubella and most recently malaria. It demonstrates what can be achieved when political commitment, strong partnerships and years of sustained public health efforts, led by the Ministry of Health and Population, come together towards a shared vision,&rdquo; said Dr Nima Abid, WHO Representative to Egypt. ""Egypt&rsquo;s achievement serves as an inspiring example for other countries in the Region and beyond.""<br /></p><h3>Successful collaboration and partnerships<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Eliminating trachoma in Egypt was the result of strong national leadership, coordinated action and broad collaboration across sectors. WHO worked closely with the Ministry of Health and Population to provide technical guidance, monitoring and validation support throughout the elimination process. The achievement was made possible through the technical and financial contributions of many partners including the Haya Karima Foundation, the Eastern Mediterranean Region Trachoma Alliance, the Nourseen Charity Foundation, the International Trachoma Initiative, the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, Sightsavers, CBM, the Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology, the Magrabi Foundation and the Tropical Data global initiative.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations to Egypt on this historic achievement in eliminating trachoma as a public health problem,&rdquo; said Dr Hanan Balkhy, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. &ldquo;Together, we have proven that with collaboration and persistence, elimination is achievable. This success reflects years of dedication and the tireless efforts of communities, health workers, and partners who stood firm in the conviction that everyone deserves to live free from preventable disease. Today, Egypt exemplifies what determination can accomplish.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><h3>Note to the editor<br /></h3><p><strong>About trachoma and neglected tropical diseases</strong><br /></p><p>Trachoma, caused by the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, is spread through contact with infected eye discharges via hands, clothes, hard surfaces and flies. Repeated infections can lead to scarring of the inner eyelid, turning eyelashes inward to scratch the cornea: a painful condition, known as trachomatous trichiasis, that can result in blindness.<br /></p><p>Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited. In 1998, WHO launched the WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020), supported by a network of governments, nongovernmental organizations and academic institutions.
