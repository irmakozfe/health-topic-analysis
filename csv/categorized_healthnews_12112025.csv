Every fraction of a degree of warming costs lives and livelihoods,&rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care at the World Health Organization. &ldquo;This report, produced with WHO as a strategic partner, makes clear that climate inaction is killing people now in all countries.&nbsp; However, climate action is also the greatest health opportunity of our time. Cleaner air, healthier diets, and resilient health systems can save millions of lives now and protect current and future generations.&rdquo;</p><h2><span>Key findings from the 2025 Lancet Countdown report</span></h2></div><div><ul><li><strong>Rising heat-related deaths:</strong> The rate of heat-related mortality has increased 23% since the 1990s, pushing total heat-related deaths to an average 546 000 deaths per year. The average person was exposed to 16 days of dangerous heat in 2024 that would not have been expected without climate change, with infants and older adults facing a total of over 20 heatwave days per person, a fourfold increase over the last twenty years.</li><li><span><strong>Wildfire and drought impacts:</strong> Droughts and heatwaves were associated with an additional 124 million people facing moderate or severe food insecurity in 2023.</span></li><li><span><strong></strong></span><strong>Economic strain:</strong> Heat exposure caused 640 billion potential labour hours to be lost in 2024, with productivity losses equivalent to US$ 1.09 trillion. The costs of heat-related deaths among older adults reached US$ 261 billion.</li><li><strong>Fossil fuel subsidies dwarf climate finance:</strong> Governments spent US$ 956 billion on net fossil fuel subsidies in 2023, more than triple the annual amount pledged to support climate-vulnerable countries. Fifteen countries spent more subsidizing fossil fuels than on their entire national health budgets.</li><li><strong>Benefits of climate action:</strong> There were an estimated 160 000 premature deaths avoided every year between 2010 and 2022, from reduced coal-derived outdoor air pollution alone. Renewable energy generation reached a record 12% of global electricity, creating 16 million jobs worldwide. Two-thirds of medical students received education in climate and health in 2024.</li></ul></div><p>&ldquo;We already have the solutions at hand to avoid a climate catastrophe &ndash; and communities and local governments around the world are proving that progress is possible. From clean energy growth to city adaptation, action is underway and delivering real health benefits &ndash; but we must keep up the momentum,&rdquo; said Dr Marina Romanello, Executive Director of the Lancet Countdown at University College London. &ldquo;Rapidly phasing out fossil fuels in favour of clean renewable energy and efficient energy use remains the most powerful lever to slow climate change and protect lives. At the same time, shifting to healthier, climate-friendly diets and more sustainable agricultural systems would massively cut pollution, greenhouse gases and deforestation, potentially saving over ten million lives a year.&rdquo;</p><div><h2>Health-promoting climate action</h2></div><p>While some governments have slowed their climate commitments, the report shows that cities, communities and the health sector are leading the way. Nearly all reporting cities (834 of 858) have completed or plan to complete climate risk assessments. The energy transition is delivering cleaner air, healthier jobs, measurable economic growth and inward investment.</p><div><p>The health sector itself has shown impressive climate leadership, with health-related greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions falling 16% globally between 2021 and 2022, while improving care quality.</p></div><p>Data submitted by WHO show that a growing number of health systems are assessing risks and preparing for the dangerous future that's coming.

Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and the world&rsquo;s leading infectious cause of blindness, no longer poses a public health threat in the country.</p><p>Trachoma is the first NTD to be eliminated in Fiji. Fiji is the 26th country to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and the 58th country globally to eliminate at least one NTD.</p><p>&ldquo;WHO congratulates Fiji and its network of global and local partners on reaching this milestone,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;Future generations of Fijians have been given a precious gift in being set free from the suffering that trachoma has inflicted on their ancestors.&rdquo;</p><p>Trachoma is caused by the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and spreads through personal contact, interactions with contaminated surfaces and on flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge of an infected person. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.</p><h2>Fiji&rsquo;s success story</h2><p>&ldquo;Fiji&rsquo;s success in eliminating trachoma is a beacon of what&rsquo;s possible when communities, governments, and partners unite behind a shared goal&rdquo;, said Dr Saia Ma&rsquo;u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a celebration of the power of Pacific leadership and the impact of sustained investment in health. WHO congratulates Fiji and is committed to supporting countries across the Region in advancing health for all so that no one is left behind.&rdquo;</p><p>Trachoma was once a significant public health problem in Fiji, with medical reports from the 1930s and community-based surveys in the 1950s documenting widespread disease and risk of blindness. By the 1980s, the condition had declined markedly, with cataract and refractive error emerging as the main causes of vision loss. </p><p>Concern however was renewed in the 2000s, when rapid assessments suggested high levels of active trachoma in children, prompting the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to launch a comprehensive programme to better understand the situation and take necessary action.</p><p>Since 2012, Fiji has undertaken a series of robust, internationally supported surveys and studies, including population-based prevalence surveys and laboratory testing, to understand the local epidemiology of trachoma and distinguish it from other causes of eye disease. This sustained effort, integrated with school health, water and sanitation initiatives, and community awareness programmes, has confirmed that trachoma is no longer a public health problem in Fiji and that systems are in place to identify and manage future cases. </p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Fiji&rsquo;s elimination of trachoma is a defining moment for health equity in the Pacific,&rdquo; said Honourable Dr Ratu Atonio Rabici Lalabalavu, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This achievement reflects years of coordinated action &ndash; across villages, health facilities and regional platforms &ndash; demonstrating unwavering commitment of our health- care workers, communities leading the change. As we celebrate this milestone, we call on our donors and partners in the Pacific and beyond to continue supporting accelerated action of neglected tropical diseases to address other diseases not only in Fiji, but across the Pacific&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Contribution to global progress<strong> </strong></h2><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases and conditions associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences.

WHO,2025-10-13 07:22:00+00:00,Vaccination,WHO warns of widespread resistance to common antibiotics worldwide,"<p>One in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections causing common infections in people worldwide in 2023 were resistant to antibiotic treatments, according to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report launched today. Between 2018 and 2023, antibiotic resistance rose in over 40% of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations monitored, with an average annual increase of 5&ndash;15%.&nbsp;</p><p>Data reported to the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) from over 100 countries cautions that increasing resistance to essential antibiotics poses a growing threat to global health.&nbsp;</p><p>The new <em><a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116337"">Global antibiotic resistance surveillance report 2025</a></em> presents, for the first time, resistance prevalence estimates across 22 antibiotics used to treat infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, the bloodstream and those used to treat gonorrhoea. The report covers 8 common bacterial pathogens &ndash; <em>Acinetobacter spp.</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella spp.</em>, <em>Shigella spp.</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>&ndash;<em> </em>each linked to one or more of these infections.<br /></p><h2>The risk of antibiotic resistance varies across the world&nbsp;</h2><p>WHO estimates that antibiotic resistance is highest in the WHO South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections were resistant. In the African Region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant. Resistance is also more common and worsening in places where health systems lack capacity to diagnose or treat bacterial pathogens.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;As countries strengthen their AMR surveillance systems, we must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines. Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests.&rdquo;</p><h2>Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are posing the greatest threat<br /></h2><p>The new report notes that drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are becoming more dangerous worldwide, with the greatest burden falling on countries least equipped to respond. Among these, <em>E. coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> are the leading drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria found in bloodstream infections. These are among the most severe bacterial infections that often result in sepsis, organ failure, and death. Yet more than 40% of <em>E. coli</em> and over 55% of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these infections. In the African Region, resistance even exceeds 70%.&nbsp;</p><p>Other essential life-saving antibiotics, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, are losing effectiveness against <em>E. coli</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. Carbapenem resistance, once rare, is becoming more frequent, narrowing treatment options and forcing reliance on last-resort antibiotics. And such antibiotics are costly, difficult to access, and often unavailable in low- and middle-income countries.<br /></p><h2>Welcome progress in AMR surveillance&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<span style=""background-color: transparent; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;"">but more action needed</span></h2><p>Country participation in GLASS has increased over four-fold, from 25 countries in 2016 to 104 countries in 2023.

WHO,2025-10-06 13:18:40+00:00,Pandemic,WHO tobacco trends report: 1 in 5 adults still addicted to tobacco,"<p>The world is smoking less, but the tobacco epidemic is far from over. A new <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116276"">WHO global report</a> shows the number of tobacco users has dropped from 1.38&nbsp;billion in 2000 to 1.2&nbsp;billion in 2024. Since 2010, the number of people using tobacco has dropped by 120 million &ndash; a 27% drop in relative terms. Yet, tobacco still hooks one in five adults worldwide, fuelling millions of preventable deaths every year.</p><p>&ldquo;Millions of people are stopping, or not taking up, tobacco use thanks to tobacco control efforts by countries around the world,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;In response to this strong progress, the tobacco industry is fighting back with new nicotine products, aggressively targeting young people. Governments must act faster and stronger in implementing proven tobacco control policies.&rdquo;</p><p>For the first time, WHO has estimated global e-cigarette use &ndash; and the numbers are alarming: more than 100&nbsp;million people worldwide are now vaping. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Adults:</strong> at least 86&nbsp;million users, mostly in high-income countries.</li><li><strong>Adolescents:</strong> at least 15&nbsp;million children (13&ndash;15 years) already using e-cigarettes. In countries with data, children are on average nine times more likely than adults to vape.</li></ul><p>The tobacco industry is introducing an incessant chain of new products and technologies for its aim to market tobacco addiction with not just cigarettes but also e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products among others, which all harm people&rsquo;s health, and more worryingly the health of new generations, youth and adolescents.</p><p>&ldquo;E-cigarettes are fuelling a new wave of nicotine addiction,&rdquo; said Etienne Krug, WHO Director of Health Determinants, Promotion and Prevention Department. &ldquo;They are marketed as harm reduction but, in reality, are hooking kids on nicotine earlier and risk undermining decades of progress.&rdquo;</p><h2>More women are quitting tobacco than men</h2><p>While there has been a steady decline in tobacco use for both men and women across all age-groups during 2000&ndash;2024, women have been leading the charge to quit tobacco. They hit the global reduction target for 2025 five years early, reaching the 30% milestone back in 2020. Prevalence of tobacco use among women dropped from 11% in 2010 to just 6.6% in 2024, with the number of female tobacco users falling from 277&nbsp;million in 2010 to 206&nbsp;million in 2024.</p><p>By contrast, men are not expected to reach the goal until 2031. Today, more than four out of five tobacco users worldwide are men, with just under 1&nbsp;billion men still using tobacco. While prevalence among men has fallen from 41.4% in 2010 to 32.5% in 2024, the pace of change is too slow.</p><h2>Regional picture</h2><ul><li><strong>South-East Asia:</strong> Once the world&rsquo;s hotspot, prevalence among men nearly halved &ndash; from 70% in 2000 to 37% in 2024. The Region alone accounts for over half of the global decline.</li><li><strong>Africa:</strong> Prevalence is the lowest of all regions at 9.5% in 2024, and the Region is on track to meet the 30% target. However, because of population growth, the absolute number of tobacco users continues to rise.</li><li><strong>Americas:</strong> The Region has achieved a 36% relative reduction, with prevalence dropping to 14% in 2024, though some countries still lack sufficient data.</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> This is now the highest-prevalence Region globally, with 24.1% of adults using tobacco in 2024, with women in Europe having the highest global prevalence at 17.4%.</li><li><strong>Eastern Mediterranean:</strong> Prevalence is 18%, with tobacco use continuing to rise in some countries.</li><li><strong>Western Pacific:</strong> With 22.9% of adults using tobacco in 2024, down from 25.8% in 2010, the progress in this Region is the slowest. While women have low prevalence at 2.5%, men have the highest prevalence of all regions at 43.3%. </li></ul><h2>Actions needed</h2><p>WHO is urging governments everywhere to step up tobacco control. This means fully implementing and enforcing the MPOWER package and the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, closing loopholes that allow the tobacco and nicotine industries to target children, and regulating new nicotine products like e-cigarettes. It also means raising tobacco taxes, banning advertising, and expanding cessation services so that millions more people can quit.</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly 20% of adults people still use tobacco and nicotine products. We cannot let up now,&rdquo; said Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care. &ldquo;The world has made gains, but stronger, faster action is the only way to beat the tobacco epidemic.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p><h3>Note to editors</h3><p>Findings of the new report titled, &ldquo;<em>WHO global report on trends in prevalence of tobacco use 2000&ndash;2024 and projections 2025&ndash;2030</em>&rdquo; are based on 2034 national surveys, covering 97% of the global population.

WHO,2025-10-03 13:55:25+00:00,Depression,Global health agencies issue new recommendations to help end deaths from postpartum haemorrhage,"<p>Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. The recommendations highlight the urgent need for earlier detection and faster intervention &ndash; steps that could save the lives of tens of thousands of women each year.</p><p>Defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, PPH affects millions of women annually and causes nearly 45&nbsp;000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma.</p><p>&ldquo;Postpartum haemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care,&rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care. &ldquo;These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited &ndash; helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families.&rdquo;</p><h2>New diagnostic criteria for rapid action</h2><p>Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the guidelines introduce new objective diagnostic criteria for detecting PPH, based on the <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01639-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">largest study</a> on the topic to date &ndash; also published today in The Lancet.</p><p>Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning <strong>early detection and rapid response</strong> is critical. Yet in many settings, especially where healthcare resources and labour wards are overstretched, delays in treatment result in devastating consequences.</p><p>Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes &ndash; simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood &ndash; so that they can act immediately when criteria are met.</p><p>The guidelines recommend the immediate deployment of the <strong><a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/09-05-2023-lifesaving-solution-dramatically-reduces-severe-bleeding-after-childbirth"">MOTIVE bundle</a> of actions once PPH has been diagnosed. This includes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>M</strong>assage of the uterus;</li><li><strong>O</strong>xytocic drugs to stimulate contractions;</li><li><strong>T</strong>ranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce bleeding;</li><li><strong>I</strong>ntravenous fluids;</li><li><strong>V</strong>aginal and genital tract examination; and</li><li><strong>E</strong>scalation of care if bleeding persists.</li></ul><p>In rare cases where bleeding continues, the guidelines recommend effective interventions such as surgery or blood transfusion to safely stabilize a woman&rsquo;s condition until further treatment becomes available.</p><p>&ldquo;Women affected by PPH need care that is fast, feasible, effective and drives progress towards eliminating PPH-related deaths,&rdquo; said Professor Anne Beatrice Kihara, President of FIGO. &ldquo;These guidelines take a proactive approach of readiness, recognition and response. They are designed to ensure real-world impact &ndash; empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts.&rdquo;</p><h2>Reducing risks through effective prevention</h2><p>The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails.</p><p>The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth.</p><p>During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort.</p><p>&ldquo;Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum haemorrhage can escalate and cost lives,&rdquo; said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM&rsquo;s Chief Midwife. &ldquo;These guidelines are a game-changer. But to end preventable deaths from PPH, we need more than evidence and protocols. We call on governments, health systems, donors, and partners to step up, adopt these recommendations, adopt them quickly, and invest in midwives and maternal care so that postpartum haemorrhage becomes a tragedy of the past.&rdquo;</p><p>The guidelines are accompanied by a <a href=""https://www.who.int/tools/bleeding-after-birth"">suite of training and implementation resources</a>, developed with partners including UNFPA. These tools consist of practical modules for frontline health workers, national-level guides for introducing new practices, and simulation-based training to strengthen emergency response.</p><p>These consolidated guidelines &ndash; the first to uniquely focus on PPH &ndash; are being launched at the 2025 FIGO World Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. They are a crucial step in the implementation of the <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240081802"">Global roadmap to combat postpartum haemorrhage </a> between 2023 and 2030.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Notes for editors</strong></h3><p>The guidelines contain 51 recommendations, drawing together existing and new evidence-based recommendations relevant to preventing, diagnosing and treating PPH. </p><p>A <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01639-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">new study</a> from WHO and the UN Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP) on diagnostic accuracy of indicators of serious postpartum bleeding involving over 300 000 women across 23 countries was also published today in The Lancet: </p><p><em>Gallos I, Williams CR, Price MJ, Tobias A, Devall A, Allotey J et al.

WHO,2025-09-24 06:10:14+00:00,Vaccination,WHO statement on autism-related issues,"<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that there is currently no conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link between autism and use of acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) during pregnancy.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Globally, nearly 62 million people (1 in 127) have autism spectrum disorder, a diverse group of conditions related to development of the brain. Although awareness and diagnosis have improved in recent years, the exact causes of autism have not been established, and it is understood there are multiple factors that can be involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Extensive research has been undertaken over the past decade, including large-scale studies, looking into links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. At this time, no consistent association has been established.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>WHO recommends that all women continue to follow advice of their doctors or health workers, who can help assess individual circumstances and recommend necessary medicines. Any medicine should be used with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first three months, and in line with advice from health professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, a robust, extensive evidence base exists showing childhood vaccines do not cause autism. Large, high-quality  studies from many countries have all reached the same conclusion. Original studies suggesting a link were flawed and have been discredited. Since 1999, independent experts advising WHO have repeatedly confirmed that vaccines&mdash;including those with thiomersal or aluminum&mdash;do not cause autism or other developmental disorders.  &nbsp;<br /></p><p>Childhood vaccine schedules are developed through a careful, extensive and evidence-based process involving global experts and country input. The childhood immunization schedule, carefully guided by WHO, has been adopted by all countries, and has saved at least 154 million lives over the past 50 years. The schedule remains essential for the health and wellbeing of every child and every community. These schedules have continually evolved with science and now safeguard children, adolescents and adults against 30 infectious diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Every vaccine recommendation by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), an independent advisory group to WHO, is grounded in rigorous review of evidence and carefully designed to offer the best protection against serious diseases and to be delivered when most needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>When immunization schedules are delayed or disrupted, or altered without evidence review, there is a sharp increase in the risk of infection not only for the child, but also for the wider community. Infants too young to be vaccinated and people with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions are at greatest risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Autism and neurodevelopmental disorders are among priority mental health and neurological conditions being discussed at the 4th UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs and mental health this Thursday, 25 September.&nbsp; As a global community, we need to do more to understand the causes of autism and how best to care for and support the needs of autistic people and their families.  &nbsp;<br /></p><p>WHO is committed to advancing this goal working together with partners including autistic-led organizations and other organizations representing persons with lived experience. WHO also stands with people who are living with autism and their families, a dignified community entitled to evidence-based considerations free of stigma.</p>",https://www.who.int/news/item/24-09-2025-who-statement-on-autism-related-issues
